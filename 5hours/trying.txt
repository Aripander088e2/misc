How about just the original idea?

integral from 0 to t of 2^(integral from 0 to y of 2^(x / 3600)dx / 300)dy

reframe 2^x as e^(ln(2)x)

integral from 0 to t of e^(ln(2) * integral from 0 to y of e^(ln(2) * x / 3600)dx / 300)dy

integral from 0 to t of e^(ln(2) / 300 * integral from 0 to y of e^(ln(2) / 3600 * x)dx)dy

e^(cx) -> integral -> e^(cx) / c

integral from 0 to t of e^(ln(2) / 300 * (e^(ln(2) / 3600 * y) - 1))dy

which doesn't really exist, ugh. let's try something we can actually calculate.

using:

600 * (e ** (6 * (e ** (x / 3600) - 1) / c) - 1)

no, make some annoying timewall for rewards to multiply by 1.5.
How about the rewards get stronger (from 1 to 1.5) at a rate of initially
a day to cap, but there's a fifth bar which makes that go twice as quick
for every 30 minutes (so at 3:00:00 it's possible, at 5:00:00 it's less
than 2 minutes)

development, efficiency, refactoring, recruitment, patience

Also, multiply production by (reached milestones + 1) (milestone every 30 minutes)

prestige works like progress; it's added just as progress is added to other progress.
