# misc
A repository of random stuff, created by dan-simon.
## folder "b"
In folder "b" lies a game named "Ass Eat", which is a parody on Hevipelle's "Mobile Money". Its gameplay is simple, the interface is intuitive, and it all works together to make sense.
## folder "b2"
In folder "b2", you can find dan-simon's easily most famous game, named Infinite Layers. The goal is to get as many layers as you can. Currently the game stops at ee308 of anything.
## big_number.js
A very simple number library that is slow but easy to understand. This works in most modern browsers easily.
## iroha
A weird notation. Can you figure out how it works? I certainly can't.
## encrypted
A file encrypted with the default 7z compression and encryption system, which is probably insecure. Can you decode it?
