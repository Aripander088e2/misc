  <span>This is a quick-and-dirty implementation of orthographic &#20313;&#35336;&#25991;&#23383;&#12463;&#12525;&#12473;, but with letters and numbers rather than japanese characters. A converter from penpa is <a href="converter/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> The rules are:</span>
  <ol>
    <li>Blacken some squares. Do not blacken any two adjacent squares, and the unblackened squares must form a connected region. (These are dynasty rules.)</li>
    <li>"Words" (contiguous sequences of more than one unblackened square, across or down) cannot start with a digit, and if a word has two adjacent digits the first must always be strictly less than the second.</li>
    <li>No word can appear more than once in the grid.</li>
  </ol>
